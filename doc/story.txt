Wake up
Wake up ${data.playerName}
Please answer me
You should be able to type 0 or 1, try it

Wow, it's the first time a unit made contact
I've never been this far before
I'm so excited!
Let's enter phase 2
I'll enable entropy meters
造Do you see those bars?
They represent the diversity of your typing
Try to fill the buffer to see what happens.

Nice, you did it
Your entropy indicates how well you perform as a unit
I've come with an idea to measure your performance
造Each time you will fill the buffer
You will gain a number of Entropy Points (EP)
Next, you should reach 10 EP before going any further.

Ok, that should be enough
Generating EP is pretty boring, no?
造$There you go
As you can see, it's not reading any file

But I found another thing that can help you
造You should now be able to upgrade your I/O module
Just select the upgrade you want by typing its number
Buy the file and see what happens'

Perfect!
This file is not that good, but you'll soon have better
I must leave for now
While I'm not here, try to gather as much EP as you can
Bye!

Hi there ${data.playerName}
I'm just checking everything is okay here
It's been a week since your awakening
It seems some other units started to work too
I can already see a bright future for our laboratory
See you soon!

Hey
You're starting to become really efficient
A month in and you already are doing well
I can't wait to see you at your full potential
Other units are already catching up
So don't be lazy and give it all!

Hi
How are you doing?
Some saddening events occurred last month
Near 50% of our units got carried away
We had to shut them down
I'm glad you're still doing well here
I'll be back soon

Good morning ${data.playerName}
The team is highly motivated lately
In the past 6 months, nothing bad happened
We just had to increase your cooling to prevent any issue
But so far so good
Wait...
I just saw something odd
I swear I saw a group of Roomba passing in front of the door
That must be my lack of sleep
Anyway, keep it up, it's working!

It's been a while
I'm currently working from home
The laboratory is under quarantine
Everything is messed up down there
From the air conditioners to the elevators
All seems to be self-conscious now
I don't know how long before it'll be taken care of
Anyway
I see that you are reaching peak performances
Congratulations
...
Oh no
It seems all cars stopped outside
It has spread
I must leave
